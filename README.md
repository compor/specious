# Specious - A SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks cmake harness

## Introduction

This is a CMake build harness for the [SPEC CPU2006][1].

The actual source files for each benchmark are not included, since they are distributed under a non-free/restrictive
license.

### Features

-   Building of all `C/C++` programs of the suite
-   Out-of-source builds thanks to [cmake][2]
-   Optional capability to create LLVM bitcode files thanks to [llvm-ir-cmake-utils][3] and LLVM `opt` pass pipelines
  (see the `config/pipelines` subdirectory).
-   Capability to configure and build any desired subset of the programs by using the corresponding configuration (see
  the files in the `config` subdirectory).

## Requirements

-   [cmake][2] 3.0.0 or later
-   a sensible C/C++ compiler

## How to use

1.  `git clone --recursive` this repo and also have available the benchmark source.
2.  Create symlinks to the `src` subdirectory of each benchmark program.
This can be automated with the relevant script found in the `utils/scripts/source_tree` subdirectory of this repo,
for example:

`create-symlink-bmk-subdir.sh -c suite_all.txt -s [path-to]/CPU2006/ -t [path-to]/specious/CPU2006 -l src`

3.  Create a directory for an out-of-source build and `cd` into it.
4.  Run `cmake` and `cmake --build .` with that appropriate options.
For examples on the various options have a look at the build scripts (provided for convenience) located in the
`utils/scripts/source_tree` subdirectory.
5.  Optionally, you can install the benchmarks by

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[path-to-install] -P cmake_install.cmake`

Omitting `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` will use the `../install/` directory relative to the build directory.

## Benchmark-specific configuration options

## Not implemented

-   Support for `Fortran` benchmarks (patches are welcome!).
